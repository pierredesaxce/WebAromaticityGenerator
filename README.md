# WebAromaticityGenerator

# Installation

## Getting the code

You can download the code by using this command where you want it to be :

```
git clone https://github.com/pierredesaxce/MolAromaProjection.git
```

### Temporary
After downloading the project, you'll be on the master branch which as not yet been updated, use this command to be on a functionning branch :

```
git checkout preprod
```

## Requirements

You need Python 3 to use this program.

https://www.python.org/downloads/

All of the needed dependencies are present in the requirement.txt file. You can download them by using :

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
in the main folder of the project that you have downloaded.

The user also need to create a file called "token". It should be formatted as follow

```
usernameOnTheCluster
passswordOnTheCluster
gmailAddressForAutoEmail
gmailPasswordForAutoEmail
```
The "gmailPasswordForAutoEmail" is a password generated by gmail. To allow the email address to be used and generate that password, follow the link in the console when booting the server for the first time. (I'll make a better guide later)


# Usage

To use it, you just need to go into the project folder and use the following command :

```
python3 api.py
```

It will open create a server on localhost using the port 5000. The user can open the main page of the website by going to [http](http://localhost:5000/) . There they can upload a .xyz file to receive a log file once the cluster is done processing it. (work in progress, the end goal should be a graph of the aromaticity of the molecule upload.
